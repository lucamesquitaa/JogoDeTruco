It is a card game called "Truco";
In this first version, in each round, the program distributes the 3 cards of the player1 and the computer through a random distribution system and stores them in a vector. Player1 is asked which of the drawn cards he wants to play, while the computer randomly chooses one of the 3 cards. After that, the weight of the cards is assigned and compared with the highest value. The process is repeated until someone manages to reach 12 points (truco rules: https://www.jogatina.com/regras-como-jogar-truco.html). At the end of the game, the user is asked if he wants to play again.

In the future, I want to add artificial intelligence to the program, a graphical interface and publish it on a website so that everyone can test it.
